	# The vanilla plan has the following issues:
	#	1. France can take too long to take the focuses that prevent war with Germany. 
	#		Especially because going down this path disables the historical German path which usually leads to a faster Demand Sudetenland.
	#	2. France loses too much stability during the process and ends up in a communist civil war.
	#	3. France ends up crippled by the swich due to low stability and low PP gain (which compound each other).
	#	4. France doesn't attempt to align belgium before germany attacks, locking out of that part of the focus tree.
	#
	# The strategy plan helps address some of the above by making France focus on taking important political focuses
	# at the expense of economic focuses, which is generally fine as they aren't in danger nearly as quickly when Germany
	# isn't invading.
	#
	# That being said, some issues are outside the scope of a strategy plan:
	#	- Taking the stability/PP advisor requires a fix on the characters side as the advisor has no base AI weight and so can't be influenced by the plan.
	# 	- Focus requirements could probably use an update so they can bypass the belgium focus or install a puppet if they're already at war or something.

	#	- Setting weights on german focuses doesn't even matter if Germany is following the historical strategy since it will always demand sudetenland
	#	- The befriend focus is exclusive to the non-historical side of the Rhineland tree so it may not even be an option.
	#	- Becoming a German puppet after delivering sudetendland will cause germany to turn all of the czechs states into a reichskommesariat.
	#	- Becoming a satelite or ally takes too long because of the absurdly high facist requirements on the previous focuses.
	#	- Non-historical Germany demands sudetenland even faster and it already takes too long to do the intended way without some discredit goverment timing or something.
